# CRUD-with-Python-and-MongoDB
A minimalist script to demonstrate CRUD functionalities using pymongo.

Short script that allows you to connect a Mongo DB to a Python script in order to do CRUD operations such as create a new entry from a JSON file, sort and show all available entries in the table, modify the information of an existing element and delete an entry.

Due to the nature of the code, all you need to run is: <br/>
* Python 3.x
* MongoDB 4.0.6
* Pymongo 3.7.2
